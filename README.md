# Navigation_Assistant_Visually_Impaired
Naan Mudhalvan IOT project

This project is an IoT-driven navigation assistant designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely using real-time obstacle detection. Built with an ESP32, ultrasonic sensors, and a buzzer, it alerts users to obstacles through audio feedback. The system was prototyped and tested using the Wokwi simulator for quick validation before hardware implementation, offering a compact, low-power, and practical mobility aid.
